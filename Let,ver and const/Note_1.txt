**1. Understanding the Basics-
- **var:** The old way to declare a variable. Its scope is limited to the function it's declared in. If declared outside a function, it's globally scoped. Re-declaration and re-assignment are allowed.
- **let:** Introduced in ES6 (2015). It has block scope, meaning it's only accessible within the block (curly braces) it's declared in. Re-assignment is allowed, but re-declaration within the same scope is not.
- **const:** Also introduced in ES6. It has block scope too, but it's used for variables that should not be re-assigned. However, the value assigned to a `const` object or array can still be changed.

**2. Key Concepts and Best Practices**
- **Scope:** Understanding the scope is crucial. `let` and `const` help prevent issues related to variable hoisting and scope leakage that `var` might cause.
- **Immutability with const:** Use `const` for variables that shouldn't be re-assigned. It makes your code more predictable and easier to debug.
- **Prefer `let` and `const` over `var`:** This prevents accidental re-declaration and makes your code cleaner and more maintainable.
